Javascript makes it possible to store data on the client side. For this we use the Storege Web API. This API accesses the browser's local storage area without time limit, meaning that the stored data will be available whenever you use this page.

localStorage is also called Web Storage or Local Storage. localStorage is a JavaScript object that we use to store data in the browser. It provides methods for storing and retrieving information. The use of the API is very simple, it is based on key-value.
