Computer programming is something that moves me a lot, especially web programming and mobile programming, I have learned to program long before i started my university (2017), since 2014 I have learned so much about web programming, i have been using extensively django and Laravel with theses framework i built lots of small projects and consequently this gave me the possibility to help many of my friends in their final project from university, nows days new tools are been created and ** React js ** is one of them, since I found out this library I have been developing small web applications to learn more about this tecnology.

Project Project is a simple project based on Firebase and Reactjs
